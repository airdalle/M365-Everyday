# How should a Microsoft Purview eDiscovery training composed of, in terms of topics ?
Here are some potential topics that could be included in a Microsoft Purview eDiscovery training:

1. Overview of the eDiscovery process: This could include a discussion of the various stages of eDiscovery, such as identification, preservation, collection, processing, review, and production.

1. Setting up and configuring Microsoft Purview: This could include instructions on how to create a Purview account, set up data sources, and create catalogs and assets.

1. Searching and reviewing data: This could include a discussion of how to create and run searches, how to review and tag data, and how to use features like filters and facets to narrow down results.

1. Exporting and reporting on findings: This could include a discussion of how to export data from Microsoft Purview, how to create custom reports, and how to use the platform's visualization and analytics features to gain insights from the data.

1. Advanced features and use cases: This could include a discussion of more advanced features of Microsoft Purview, such as how to use the platform for cross-matter analysis, how to use it to support internal investigations, and how to use it to perform data analytics tasks.

1. Best practices and considerations: This could include a discussion of best practices for using Microsoft Purview, such as how to ensure data integrity, how to handle large data sets, and how to manage data privacy and security.

It's also a good idea to include hands-on exercises and case studies to give participants the opportunity to practice using the platform and apply what they have learned to real-world scenarios.

# What are the best practices to run an ediscovery case with microsoft purview ?
Here are some best practices for running an eDiscovery case with Microsoft Purview:

1. Define the scope of the case: Clearly define the scope of the case, including the specific data sources that you want to search and the types of data that you are looking for. This will help ensure that you are focusing on the most relevant data and that you are not wasting time on unrelated information.

1. Set up data sources: Set up the data sources that you want to search in Microsoft Purview. This might include cloud storage accounts, on-premises data stores, or both.

1. Create catalogs and assets: Create catalogs and assets in Microsoft Purview to organize and classify the data that you are searching. This will make it easier to search and review the data later on.

1. Run searches: Run searches to identify the data that is relevant to your case. You can use the search functionality in Microsoft Purview to find specific keywords, metadata values, or other data points.

1. Review and tag data: Review the data that you have identified and tag it with relevant metadata or labels to help organize and classify it. This can make it easier to review and analyze the data later on.

1. Export and report on findings: Once you have completed your review, you can export the data from Microsoft Purview and create custom reports to present your findings.

1. Follow best practices for data integrity: Be sure to follow best practices for data integrity, such as making sure that data is not altered or deleted during the eDiscovery process.

By following these best practices, you can effectively run an eDiscovery case with Microsoft Purview and identify the data that is most relevant to your case.


# What are the best practices for data integrity ?
Here are some best practices for maintaining data integrity during the eDiscovery process:

1. Follow legal and regulatory requirements: Make sure to follow all relevant legal and regulatory requirements for preserving and collecting data. This might include putting legal holds in place to prevent data from being deleted or altered, and following specific protocols for collecting and handling data.

1. Use a secure and reliable eDiscovery platform: Use a secure and reliable eDiscovery platform, such as Microsoft Purview, to ensure that data is handled and stored securely.

1. Use a chain of custody process: Implement a chain of custody process to track and document the handling of data throughout the eDiscovery process. This will help ensure that data is not altered or deleted and that it can be traced back to its original source.

1. Use hashing and deduplication: Use hashing and deduplication techniques to ensure that data is not altered or corrupted during the eDiscovery process. Hashing is a process that generates a unique code for each data file, while deduplication is a process that removes duplicate copies of data.

1. Verify the integrity of data: Verify the integrity of data by comparing it to the original source or using other techniques to ensure that it has not been altered.

By following these best practices, you can help ensure that data is preserved and handled correctly during the eDiscovery process, which is essential for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the data.
