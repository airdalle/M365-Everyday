- In doc understanding models, its important that the signals you give #Syntex through labelling and explanations match. If they contradict each other then the model will be less accurate

- When using #Syntex in a multi-geo M365 tenant, models can only run in the central location by default. If you want to use models in a satellite location, contact Microsoft support who can enable on your behalf

- If you use #Syntex, your data and models stay yours- Microsoft aren't doing any deep learning from your content. Everything stays within your M365 privacy and compliance boundary

- If you use date fields in #Syntex content assembly, you can use many formats common to documents- such as "MM/DD/YYYY", "Month, D YYYY", or Day DDth Month YYYY" #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/e4j3h3Z5

- When applying a #Syntex model to a library, you can choose to create a new view. This includes the ability to create a tile view showing a file thumbnail and the extracted metadata #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- Every page you run through #Syntex form processing uses 500 AI Builder credits. If you need to process large documents, think carefully about whether there are specific pages you can focus the processing on #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- The #Syntex assessment can be run on all M365 environments- including GCC, GCCH, and DoD. To run against for these cloud environments, you'll need to update the assessment configuration file #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/emTSFYwB

- To edit a #Syntex modern template, select "Edit New menu" under the New menu of a doc library. From here you can edit, unpublish or delete any modern templates #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/enSmcNFv

- If you're making use of hub sites in #SharePoint, #Syntex brings the ability to push content types to hubs. They will then be applied to all sites associated with that hub #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eYZKKN8F

- Explanation templates in #Syntex unstructured models are stored in a list- and you can use #PnPPowerShell or #PnPCoreSDK to work with them. There are PS samples on MS Learn to get you started #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eYknKTwq 

- The easiest way to see which #Syntex models are running on a document library is to click the "classify and extract" button when no files are selected. This will show all applied and available models for that location #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- Where your #Syntex doc understanding models need to be similar, you can use the duplicate option to make your training more efficient. Copy, and then focus on the changes #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eH_GguaK

- Need to estimate how many #AIBuilder credits you need to run your #Syntex structured and freeform document processing models? Use the AI Builder calculator- each page of processing uses 500 credits #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eGGR7RXp

- When configuring #Syntex prebuilt models you only need to provide 1 sample file. This sample is analysed to help you choose which pre-trained extractors to include during processing #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eznNDFqm 

- Syntex document understanding models train and run on the first 64k characters of a document. If the doc needs OCR, up to 500 pages will be read, but the 64k processing limit remains #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- Syntex content assembly can create either .docx or .pdf files from the same template. Just choose the format you want when generating a file from the template #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- Want to extract checkbox values from a document? #Syntex form processing has you covered- checkbox values can be extracted from documents and written to boolean columns in SharePoint #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- Want to extract data from image files that aren't machine readable? What about handwritten content? All #Syntex models will automatically include OCR for content that can't be read directly #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- If you want to use retention labels with #Syntex models, remember they need to be published and available in the sites where you'll create and run the models #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eXPpVD-F

- Syntex structured document processing models include an accuracy score for the model as a whole and each individual extractor. Use this to help understand where more samples would help during training https://lnkd.in/eSm2bgXh

- The first #Syntex content center created on a tenant is special in one important way. It rolls up model analytics data from all other content centers and sites on the tenant https://lnkd.in/efswcQwv

- If you select a whole folder for processing in #Syntex, it will be sent to an off peak queue for processing. Off peak is considered out of business hours for the location of your M365 tenant

- Are you using term sets in #SharePoint? Know how they're being used? #Syntex includes term store reports, helping you understand the composition and change of the taxonomy #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eM6j7f4i

- During the preview of #Syntex pay-as-you-go, you won't see entries in the Microsoft Cost Management dashboard. This is because the usage meters have no charge. To see the data, export a CSV of all usage #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eSebQz9b

- How many files should you use when training a #Syntex document understanding model? Worry less about the number of files, instead try and capture as much real world variation as you can. #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- A great place to start with #Syntex models are libraries that use multiple content types- automating the organisation process. The Syntex Assessment will tell you where to find these libraries #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eBdiTZwJ

- The option to select a custom Power Platform environment in #Syntex only appears when you have environments that have both: - #AIBuilder credits assigned // - The AI Builder for Project Cortex app installed
https://lnkd.in/egtipXWn

- If you only see 3 options in the #Syntex new model menu, then you may not have configured your current location to use #AIBuilder models. Just add that site in the admin center to see all 5 model options #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/exGrpH_r

- You can configure #Syntex form processing models to use either the default or a custom Power Platform environment. To use a custom environment, remember to install the AI Builder for Project Cortex app #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/etEnhTwr

- Did you know? #Syntex users can use metadata search on ANY document library, not just libraries where models are running. It’s a great way to make the most of all of that lovely metadata #SyntexTipOfTheDay
https://lnkd.in/eHRfnvPG

- Mapping a #Syntex extractor to a taxonomy field opens up a world of possibility- normalise synonyms, validate extracted data, or populate the term set. Many options to take your model to the next level #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/efVR7mUe

- Form processing models use AI Builder credits for every page you process. For every #Syntex license on your tenant we bundle 3,500 monthly credits, up to a max of 1 million. More credits can be purchased for additional processing #SyntexTipOfTheDay 

- You can run multiple document understanding models on a single library. For each file, #Syntex will evaluate against all of the models. The most appropriate match will be applied to each file- automatically sorting your content #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- The best way to move #Syntex doc understadning models between tenants is with #PnPPowerShell. One cmdlet to export a model along with its training files, making it fully viewable and editable after import #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eiUjUNuU

- All #Syntex content centers allow you to create a sample model directly in the models library. But we have more sample doc understanding models out on GitHub. Find some inspiration, or share your own models #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://aka.ms/pnp/syntex

- For the best #Syntex assessment results, we recommend you analyse your entire tenant. Limiting to a small set of sites will tend to tell you things you already know. Scope wide to learn what you don’t know about your content #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/dj8gbV3Q

- Freeform & Unstructured #Syntex models are powered by #AIBuilder. The model in the content center is only part of the story, with other assets kept in Dataverse. This is why you can't export/import these model types. Current methods only move the parts in SP

- Use the "SyntexFull" option in the #Syntex assessment to generate the most detailed reports. This mode requires full control permissions on sites to run, but includes the most accurate counts of content types, retention labels and more

- If you're updating a #Syntex model such as adding or removing extractors, then you will need to sync the model to the libraries where its assigned. This will update the content type and columns accordingly
https://lnkd.in/eQp4C_xz

- When setting up #Syntex pay-as-you-go, you're asked to select an Azure subscription, resource group and region. This is only the location where the cost management data will stored. There's no change to where your files are stored or processed #SyntexTipOfTheDay 

- In #Syntex content assembly you can generate files as .docx and .pdf. To do this when using the "Generate document using Syntex (preview)" action in #PowerAutomate , simply specify .pdf or .docx in the name property #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/ehPRTvJk

- Syntex prebuilt models for invoices and receipts currently support English language only. The invoice model will work on US samples. The receipt model will work on samples from Australia, Canada, US, UK, and India #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eetGGbwH 

- Before building models in #Syntex, think about what the metadata is for- search experiences, automation, compliance? If you can't say what you'd use the metadata for, is it worth extracting? Focus on extracting the data that will have a meaningful outcome

- When choosing training files for a #Syntex structured document processing model, use samples that have fields filled in for everything you want to extract. Files with empty fields can be processed, but for training a completed set of forms is required

- Using #Syntex to process unstructured files can mean a key choice on model type. If your files are PDFs/images and English, you can use either the teaching method or freeform.
Start with freeform- simpler training, quickly test whether to change to teaching

- When setting up #Syntex, the option to configure where to allow structured and freeform models is related to creation. These are the sites where those models can be trained, you don't need to add the sites where you want to models to be applied for file processing

- Are you using freeform or structured models in #Syntex? AI Builder credits now go further, with each page processed consuming 100 credits (previously 500). See Feb 23 license guide for detail https://lnkd.in/eDXvMvuJ

- Syntex doc understanding models have no semantic understanding of your content. They see your document as a set of "tokens". One result of this is that you need to handle variation and spelling errors in your explanations #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/ex8EB9Ed

- The best people to train #Syntex models are usually subject matter experts in the content that is being used. Technical skills aren't as important as an understanding of the content- especially when using the teaching method. Content AI for everyone #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- When should you create extra #Syntex content centers? A good reason is permissions. Users on each content center can access all training files and models. Create a new one where you need a security boundary. E.g. different departments, teams, or projects #SyntexTipOfTheDay 

- In #Syntex models, don't get obsessed with the accuracy score. Its a guide on how your model handles the training files, but the best test is on real libraries. For any use case, a lower score might give you the right output.
Focus on output, not a number #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- If you create an #AIBuilder powered model in #Syntex (structured or freeform), it now doesn't use Power Automate to execute the model. Processing is triggered internally- don't be surprised that new flows aren't being automatically created #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- The freeform document processing model is a new model type to #Syntex that allows you to extract information from unstructured files. Training is simple- just select the entities you want to extract from the sample files #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/ep92JfTx

- A handy way of thinking about the #Syntex custom model options, and how you interact with them...
Freeform- train WHAT the model should look for
Structured- train WHERE the model can find something
Unstructured- train HOW the model should find something

- Importing content to a library through the #SharePoint Migration API will now trigger #Syntex processing if you have a model enabled. For example when using SPMT or a third party migration tool. No more manual processing requests for migration scenarios! #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- In doc understanding, #Syntex will implicitly look for a proximity between an explanation and your label. Use an explicit proximity explanation where there is predictable distance or sequence in your content #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/ertbVBhT

- When planning #Syntex models, consider your altitude. Train for types of content rather than categories. Instead of "project documents", think of granular assets- project plans, statements of work etc. This is the level where you should be building models #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- Each #Syntex model will automatically create a content type. If you're already using content types though, you can choose to associate a model with an existing one- reusing your current #SharePoint information architecture and powering it with automation #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- Are you looking for self service #Syntex training? We've just refreshed our introductory training to cover more of the Microsoft Syntex features #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/e9DKq7dy

- Now that #Syntex structured and freeform models can be created in a content center, they behave the same way as unstructured models. You can publish them, reuse across multiple libraries and use the "classify and extract" button in doc libraries #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- When columns are created by a #Syntex model, they are created as site columns. This means they automatically have a managed property created in the search schema- enabling use in metadata search, compliance, and custom search experiences #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- Freeform models in #Syntex require minimal trainer input. But there is more complexity behind the scenes than structured models. After you've labelled, it will take 20-30 minutes to process before the model is ready to publish. Perfect time for a cup of tea #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- You don't always need a content center to create #Syntex document understanding or prebuilt models. If you only need to use a model on a single site, then you can activate local model creation on that site #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eSKJqjux

- If you need to use the same explanation in multiple #Syntex doc understanding models, then save it as an explanation template. Think about common entities that appear in many document types- employee IDs, project names, products #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eJg4AFi5

- We've updated the names of the #Syntex custom models.
Unstructured document processing = Document Understanding
Structured document processing = Form processing
Freeform document processing = a new model type powered by #AIBuilder
https://lnkd.in/eFh_nuUH

- If you're using a custom Power Platform environment for form processing, don't forget to grant your #Syntex users permissions as well as granting them a Syntex license. Environment Maker for model builders and Basic User for model users #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/etEnhTwr

- All #Syntex model types can be used to apply retention labels to content. Doc understanding models can also be used to apply sensitivity labels. Labels are added at the time the model runs- a great complement to manual or policy based assignment with Purview #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- We often use the phrase “machine teaching” when talking about #Syntex document understanding. This isn’t just marketing fluff, it’s a different way to think about training a model. Read some of the original research here #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eheEwTeH

- The preview of #Syntex pay-as-you-go is rolling out now. To see if its arrived on your tenant, visit the Setup section of Admin Center. The setup page will have the updated name "Use content AI with Microsoft Syntex". #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/dfdMmmNg

- Syntex annotations are "non-destructive". This means they don't edit the underlying file. Useful for interacting with files that need to preserved as records. Markings are stored in SharePoint as a layer that can be seen through the file viewer #SyntexTipOfTheDay

- When building #Syntex doc understanding models, do you start with the classifier or extractors? Either work, but if you need many extractors start there. Each extractor becomes a model reference in the classifier, so you may not need any extra explanations 

- Need to generate table data in templated documents? #Syntex content assembly has you covered- use each item in a list to be a row in a table #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/ezKVNUNC

- The public preview of #Syntex pay-as-you-go is coming this month. That gives free access to unstructured and prebuilt models while the preview is running. To prepare, get ready with an Azure subscription ID and a storage container #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/e3cZrqxE

- From a content center, #Syntex users can publish models to any library they have edit rights to, for re-use. SharePoint admins can choose to publish a model to ALL libraries. Allowing it to be added by local users on that library #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/ePzXYeGe

- You can make a #Syntex document understanding model reusable on your tenant by publishing it. Once published, other Syntex users can discover, evaluate, and add the model to their libraries- amplifying the impact of the automation #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/dAECQm-q

- Syntex content assembly templates can use manual values, term sets or list items. If you have several placeholders coming from a single list, they will all populate based on the item you select. Faster and less room for error #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/etSMYzjS

- You often need to begin another business process once #Syntex has finished extracting data. In Power Automate, use the "When a file is classified by a content understanding model" trigger in the SharePoint connector to do this without messy wait loops

- If your documents contain consistent tables, form processing in #Syntex can extract the table rows into a SharePoint list. Each processed document includes a link to a filtered list view, showing the relevant items #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/ehVpdcmj

- Create as many #Syntex content centers as you need. You could create them for departments, teams, or projects. We don't recommend granular permissions, so security of models and training files is usually a good reason to split #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/em4NE9sP

- Content assembly in #Syntex now support images. This field type in modern templates also allows images to be automatically resized during file creation #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eSrEwK7v

- Need to move or copy a file automatically in a library? #Syntex now includes content processing rules that let you sort content based on content type or metadata #SyntexTipOfTheDay https://lnkd.in/eexJdnN3

- When using the #Syntex move and copy rules, metadata will be preserved if the same content types or columns are on the target library. If a subset of columns are available, only those values will be kept. Missing columns won't block moving or copying a file

- The latest capability in Syntex are annotations- add notes and marking to files using the native M365 file viewer https://lnkd.in/ehJKMXnJ

- Syntex annotations are currently supported on PDF and TIFF files, with more file type support coming
